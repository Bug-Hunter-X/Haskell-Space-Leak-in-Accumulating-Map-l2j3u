This code suffers from a space leak.  The `Data.Map` is updated in each iteration of the loop but never garbage collected.  In a long-running application, this could lead to significant memory consumption.

```haskell
import qualified Data.Map as Map

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let initialMap = Map.empty
  let finalMap = loop 1000000 initialMap
  print $ Map.size finalMap

loop :: Int -> Map.Map Int Int -> Map.Map Int Int
loop 0 map = map
loop n map = loop (n - 1) (Map.insert n n map)
```
